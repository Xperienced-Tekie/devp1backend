    "description": "\"As the silcon based hive mind propagates itself across the entire surface of the planet, Perion-5 is slowly transformed from a desert wasteland into some kind of celestial paradise. The planet itself has started to come alive as a symbiotic relationship is formed between the terrestial body and the new inhabitants forced onto its surface.  Since we banished them from our lands, our planet has continued to deteriorate while the barren wasteland they now call home has gone through a transformative metamorphosis. Maybe we were wrong about them. Perhaps they contain more of a soul than we do trapped in these husks of flesh and bone.   Sadly, they took with them the technology that allowed people upload their consciousness into the mainframe; the Transcendence as it is now called. To become a part of their celestial chorus would require traversing the 250 light years that separate us; a journey reminiscent of a slow death but many are willing still to journey into this... afterlife  *The second installment of an ongoing philisophical exploration of disembodied consciousness.\"",

The observer witnesses the angel's transformation from a pure white form into a striking black silhouette, representing its fusion with the universe. This metamorphosis occurs in cycles, with the angel reverting to its white form, symbolizing rebirth and renewal. The angel's appearance changes according to the time of day, with its white form appearing during daylight hours and its dark form emerging at night.",

    "description": "\"For the past 2 years, I have been working on female beauty through portraits illustrating skin texture, focus with depth of field, grain and light. Red Mask is one of those memorable portraits that is part of this series.  My work is to reveal above all the natural beauty of a woman without resorting to artifice, but for Red Mask I wanted to accentuate the almost \"\"supernatural\"\" strength of women, a bit like a wonder woman. The simplicity is mixed with the supernatural and sometimes this is done naturally by seizing the right moment, sometimes by adding an extra stroke as on Red Mask. More broadly, I'm constantly looking for that \"\"switch\"\" that makes the natural pass into the supernatural.\"",

    "description": "This macro photo of the ichneumon wasp captures its striking face and eyes in incredible detail. The wasp's head is perfectly centred in the frame, with its enormous green eyes taking up the majority of the space. The iridescent green colour of the eyes is stunning, reflecting the surrounding light and creating a mesmerising visual effect.\n\nThe ichneumon wasp is a type of parasitic wasp that belongs to the family Ichneumonidae. They are named after the ancient Greek word \"\"ichneumon,\"\" which means \"\"tracker\"\" or \"\"hunter.\"\" Ichneumon wasps are found all over the world, with over 100,000 species identified so far.\n\nThe adult ichneumon wasp does not harm humans or other animals; they primarily feed on nectar and pollen from flowers. However, the female ichneumon wasp has a unique and fascinating method of reproduction. She will search for a host insect, such as a caterpillar or beetle, and then use her ovipositor (a long, needle-like structure) to lay her eggs inside the host's body. Once the eggs hatch, the wasp larvae will feed on the host's tissues, eventually killing it.\n\nDespite their parasitic nature, ichneumon wasps are considered beneficial insects in many ecosystems. They can help to control pest populations by targeting insects that damage crops or other plants. In fact, some species of ichneumon wasps are specifically used as biological control agents in agriculture.\n\nIchneumon wasps have long been studied by scientists due to their intricate life cycles and important ecological roles. They continue to fascinate and intrigue entomologists and nature enthusiasts alike.",

    "description": "Footage shot at the art studio of artist and actor Raymond J. Barry, who is the subject of this work.   .mp4 | 2023 __________________________ Accompanying poem from my collection of works TIMEZOO:  One time I flew too close to the sun. Some people believe the sun is a portal to other dimensions and you have to fly right through it. I use sunscreen. I don’t mind getting burned, but it itches. I usually get a good tan. The sun is there even when there are clouds. But like clouds, the sun will one day be no longer. And like the seekers thirst for knowing and becoming, it is impermanent. The dimensions, all collapse upon themselves. The knowing and becoming leads to more knowing and becoming till there is nothing to know and nothing to become, or at least what is to know and what is to become is beyond knowing and becoming. Ya dig? So All the suns breathe out their fire till all desire to become one that is all known and all becometh is obliterated. Light works in mysterious ways. Love even more so. And what’s left to be said, or felt, or experienced well... It’s Not dark, not cold, not light, not warm, hey- not not any of those aspects either. Have at it. Not a here or there, not an I or an Other, but sure for a point of reference you gotta be somewhere. I get it. Though what’s being referred to .... oh man ... that’s a hoot. Owls. Love em. Their Intellect Imagination Haunts The Time Zoo. Peering Moon Eyes With Prophecy To The Prompt. Some may say it’s the start, some the end, maybe others go for an unknown between. Not those either. Unless you put 'em in a blender, Quantum Prana Paradox Processor, food that lasts a lifetime. No shelf life. No shelf. I mean self. Small S, big s, no S. Don’t stress. Essence. Nice fragrance. Whistle While You Work.  Compare your lists, check off the boxes, read the articles, read the books, see the signs, the synchronicities, The simplicities, the strange familiar. Ha. Funny how this works when you try and break it all down. Beauty in that. Consider all the angles, all the possibilities, all the mechanics and variations of an unknowable knowing. Get to the root. Gotta get to the root. Shut the Fuck up. The root. The source. Hey man, You’ll be diggin for a long time, it will take you right on way down headlong through the sky feet first in all directions Christ hands outstretched deep underneath the cosmic sea in the belly of a whale, and it will burp you on out, shovel in hand, dirt in your face, right through the fucking sun. Another dimension. Little alteration to your timeline. You remember you tried this before? By all means go ahead if you want. Same thing expecting different results. It’s not to say don’t endeavor baby, don’t dream, and don’t play - do that. You’re just not gonna ever contain it in the way you want. It’s not gonna fit in a neat little package for you to digest. There will be gifts and lots of em. Here and now. The greatest Present. Perhaps the only one. Everything else is just icing on the cake and a sour face. If I were to write this as a book, there would be no letters, no pictures, not a single page to bind together - and if I tried to hand it to you, it would be far too heavy. For now the sun feels good. Shining down on me, in whatever solar system, whatever dimension, or planet, or form or experience I am in. I’m ok with that. I think that’s wonderful. Louis Armstrong wrote a song about it.",
